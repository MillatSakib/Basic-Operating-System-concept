### Basic CLI command

1. If we want to know in which directory now I am then we can use `pwd` command.

```sh
pwd
```

2. If we want to see all file and folder on my current directory then we can execute the command below:

```sh
ls
```

But the command `ls` can't not see hidden file. If we want to see the hidden file the we can use the command below:

```sh
ls -a
```

3. If we want to see any plain text file from terminal then we can execute the command below:

```sh
cat fileName.extension
```

4. If we open a plain text file in terminal then we can use `vim` execute the command below:

```sh
vim fileName.extension
```

But after open the file using vim we can't directly edit that file. We have to press `I` first for insert then we can edit data. And for save and exit we have to press `Esc` at first and then write `:wq` and press enter.
